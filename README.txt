 Freecodecamp Front-end Project # 3
 
 *** NOTES FROM DEVELOPER:
 First time using SCSS in a project after learning it a week ago. It is really cool and useful, but maybe not so much for this particular project (since it's a relatively small project with not a lot of styling). This project gave me a better understanding of how to use SCSS (mixins, inheritance, variables, and nesting.) I also used jQuery for the fancy looking fade effects when users request a new quote which is pulled from forismatic.com API, also using jQuery.
